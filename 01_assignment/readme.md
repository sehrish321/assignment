# Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs)
Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) are systems designed to interact with users through conversation, using natural language processing and understanding. They enable users to communicate with technology via spoken or typed language, allowing for tasks such as querying information, controlling devices, or getting assistance. CUIs can be found in various applications, including chatbots, voice assistants, and customer service interfaces. Their main advantage is their ability to offer a more intuitive and human-like interaction compared to traditional graphical user interfaces, making technology more accessible and user-friendly.
