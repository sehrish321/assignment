# Differentiate between AI, machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and applied AI.

### 1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
   - **What it is:** AI is like giving machines a bit of "brainpower" so they can do tasks that normally need human thinking, like making decisions or understanding language.
   - **Example:** A virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa, which can understand your voice and help you with tasks.

### 2. **Machine Learning (ML):**
   - **What it is:** Think of machine learning as teaching a computer by showing it lots of examples so it can figure out patterns and make decisions on its own.
   - **Example:** A movie recommendation system on Netflix that suggests movies based on what you've watched before.

### 3. **Deep Learning:**
   - **What it is:** Deep learning is a more advanced type of machine learning. It's like giving the computer a very deep "brain" with many layers, which helps it understand more complex things, like recognizing faces in photos.
   - **Example:** The technology behind facial recognition on your smartphone that unlocks the phone when it sees your face.

### 4. **Generative AI:**
   - **What it is:** Generative AI is when a computer creates something new—like writing a story, drawing a picture, or even composing music—by learning from a lot of existing examples.
   - **Example:** A program that can create a brand-new piece of music after learning from a bunch of songs.

### 5. **Applied AI:**
   - **What it is:** Applied AI is about taking all these smart AI tools and using them in real-world situations to solve problems or make things work better.
   - **Example:** An AI system used in hospitals to help doctors diagnose diseases faster by analyzing medical images.
